    date: 'April 1, 2025',
    author: 'Ahmed Gharib',
    category: 'Data Engineering',
    content: `
      <p>The field of data engineering has evolved significantly over the past few years. In 2025, organizations are embracing several modern practices to handle the increasing volume, variety, and velocity of data.</p>
      
      <h2>The Rise of Decentralized Data Architecture</h2>
      <p>Data Mesh has emerged as a dominant architectural pattern, moving away from centralized data lakes and warehouses. Organizations are now treating data as a product, with domain-oriented ownership and distributed governance.</p>
      
      <p>Key components of this approach include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Domain-oriented data ownership and architecture</li>
        <li>Data as a product</li>
        <li>Self-serve data infrastructure</li>
        <li>Federated computational governance</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Real-time Processing as the New Standard</h2>
      <p>Batch processing is increasingly being replaced by real-time streaming architectures. Modern data stacks now routinely incorporate technologies like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apache Kafka for event streaming</li>
        <li>Apache Flink for stateful stream processing</li>
        <li>Materialize for real-time materialized views</li>
        <li>ksqlDB for stream processing with SQL</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Observability and Testing</h2>
      <p>Data quality issues can have significant downstream impacts. Modern data engineering practices now include comprehensive testing and monitoring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data contract testing to validate producer-consumer relationships</li>
        <li>Great Expectations for automated testing of data quality</li>
        <li>dbt for transformation tests</li>
        <li>Monte Carlo and other tools for data observability</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Infrastructure as Code and DataOps</h2>
      <p>DevOps practices have been fully embraced by data teams, with infrastructure-as-code becoming standard:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Terraform for provisioning data infrastructure</li>
        <li>CI/CD pipelines for data transformations</li>
        <li>Version control for all data assets</li>
        <li>Automated testing in staging environments before production deployment</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Polyglot Persistence</h2>
      <p>The rise of purpose-built databases means organizations are increasingly using different database technologies for different use cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vector databases for machine learning feature storage (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate)</li>
        <li>Graph databases for relationship analysis (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)</li>
        <li>Time-series databases for IoT and monitoring data (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)</li>
        <li>Document databases for semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB, Firestore)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Cost Optimization</h2>
      <p>As data volumes grow, cost management has become a critical concern:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data virtualization to query data in place without movement</li>
        <li>Tiered storage strategies with automatic archiving</li>
        <li>Query optimization and caching layers</li>
        <li>Usage-based resource allocation</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The modern data engineering landscape is characterized by decentralization, real-time processing, robust testing, and specialized storage solutions. Organizations that adopt these practices are better positioned to extract value from their data assets while maintaining governance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized many aspects of software development, and data engineering is no exception. In this article, we'll explore practical ways to integrate LLMs into data engineering pipelines to enhance productivity and create more intelligent data systems.</p>
      
      <h2>Automated Data Quality Checks</h2>
      <p>LLMs can be trained to identify patterns and anomalies in data that traditional rule-based systems might miss:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Detecting semantic inconsistencies in text data</li>
        <li>Identifying problematic data patterns through natural language descriptions</li>
        <li>Generating data quality rules based on historical issues</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Example implementation using LangChain and great_expectations:</p>
      <pre class="code-block">
      from langchain.llms import OpenAI
      from great_expectations.core import ExpectationSuite
      
      def generate_data_quality_rules(dataset_description, sample_data):
          llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-4")
          prompt = f"""
          Given the following dataset description and sample:
          
          Description: {dataset_description}
          
          Sample data:
          {sample_data}
          
          Generate a comprehensive list of data quality rules that would 
          be important to enforce, expressed as Great Expectations expectations.
          """
          
          rules = llm.generate(prompt)
          # Convert to Great Expectations format
          # ...
          
          return expectation_suite
      </pre>
      
      <h2>Automated Documentation Generation</h2>
      <p>Documentation is often the most neglected aspect of data engineering. LLMs can help by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generating comprehensive data dictionaries</li>
        <li>Creating documentation for complex SQL queries and transformations</li>
        <li>Explaining data lineage in natural language</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Example using LLM to document dbt models:</p>
      <pre class="code-block">
      import os
      import yaml
      from langchain.llms import Anthropic
      
      def document_dbt_model(model_sql_path):
          with open(model_sql_path, 'r') as f:
              sql_code = f.read()
          
          llm = Anthropic(model="claude-2")
          prompt = f"""
          Here is a dbt SQL model:
          
          {sql_code}
          
          Please provide:
          1. A clear description of what this model does
          2. Documentation for each column
          3. Any business logic encoded in this transformation
          4. Dependencies and downstream effects
          
          Format as YAML for a dbt schema.yml file.
          """
          
          documentation = llm.generate(prompt)
          
          # Save as schema.yml
          # ...
      </pre>
      
      <h2>Data Transformation Assistance</h2>
      <p>LLMs can help write and optimize complex data transformations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Converting business requirements into SQL or Python code</li>
        <li>Optimizing existing transformations for performance</li>
        <li>Translating between different transformation languages (SQL to Spark, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Semantic Data Discovery</h2>
      <p>Finding the right data in large organizations is challenging. LLMs can enable natural language search across data assets:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating and maintaining embeddings of data catalog entries</li>
        <li>Enabling natural language querying of data catalogs</li>
        <li>Suggesting related datasets based on semantic similarity</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Implementation example with a vector database:</p>
      <pre class="code-block">
      from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
      from langchain.vectorstores import Pinecone
      import pinecone
      
      # Initialize embeddings model
      embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
      
      # Initialize Pinecone
      pinecone.init(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", environment="YOUR_ENV")
      index_name = "data-catalog"
      
      # Store dataset descriptions and metadata
      texts = ["This dataset contains daily sales transactions from our retail stores",
               "Customer demographic information including age, location, and preferences",
               "Product inventory and supply chain tracking data"]
               
      metadatas = [
          {"name": "retail_sales", "owner": "Sales Team", "update_frequency": "Daily"},
          {"name": "customer_demographics", "owner": "Marketing", "update_frequency": "Monthly"},
          {"name": "inventory", "owner": "Operations", "update_frequency": "Hourly"}
      ]
      
      # Create vectorstore
      vector_db = Pinecone.from_texts(texts, embeddings, metadatas=metadatas, index_name=index_name)
      
      # Later, search using natural language
      query = "Where can I find data about what products customers are buying?"
      results = vector_db.similarity_search(query, k=2)
      </pre>
      
      <h2>Intelligent Data Lineage</h2>
      <p>Understanding how data flows through an organization is critical. LLMs can help:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extracting lineage information from code and documentation</li>

    category: 'Data Architecture',
    content: `
      <p>As organizations increasingly need to process data in real-time, streaming data architectures have become essential. This article provides a comprehensive guide to designing and implementing robust streaming architectures using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and modern cloud services.</p>
      
      <h2>Understanding Streaming Data Architecture</h2>
      <p>A streaming data architecture enables the continuous processing of data in real-time, as opposed to batch processing which operates on chunks of data at scheduled intervals. Key components include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Event sources that generate data streams</li>
        <li>Stream processing engines that transform and analyze data</li>
        <li>Storage systems for both raw and processed data</li>
        <li>Serving layers for query and analysis</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Building Blocks of Modern Streaming Architecture</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Apache Kafka as the Central Nervous System</h3>
      <p>Apache Kafka has become the de facto standard for implementing streaming data platforms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High throughput message broker</li>
        <li>Durable storage with configurable retention</li>
        <li>Scalability through partitioning</li>
        <li>Connect API for integrating with external systems</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Sample Kafka producer code in Python:</p>
      <pre class="code-block">
      from kafka import KafkaProducer
      import json
      
      # Configure the producer
      producer = KafkaProducer(
          bootstrap_servers=['kafka-broker:9092'],
          value_serializer=lambda x: json.dumps(x).encode('utf-8')
      )
      
      # Send messages
      def send_event(event):
          producer.send('events-topic', value=event)
          
      # Example event
      event = {
          'user_id': '12345',
          'event_type': 'page_view',
          'timestamp': '2025-02-28T15:22:31Z',
          'page': '/products/1234',
          'metadata': {
              'user_agent': 'Mozilla/5.0...',
              'referrer': 'https://www.google.com'
          }
      }
      
      send_event(event)
      </pre>

      # Initialize Spark
      spark = SparkSession.builder \
          .appName("StreamProcessor") \
          .getOrCreate()
      
      # Read from Kafka
      events_df = spark \
          .readStream \
          .format("kafka") \
          .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "kafka-broker:9092") \
          .option("subscribe", "events-topic") \
          .load()
      
      # Parse JSON payload
      from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StringType, TimestampType
      from pyspark.sql.functions import from_json
      
      schema = StructType() \
          .add("user_id", StringType()) \
          .add("event_type", StringType()) \
          .add("timestamp", TimestampType()) \
          .add("page", StringType())
      
      parsed_events = events_df \
          .select(from_json(col("value").cast("string"), schema).alias("data")) \
          .select("data.*")
      
      # Calculate page views per minute
      page_counts = parsed_events \
          .withWatermark("timestamp", "10 minutes") \
          .groupBy(
              window(col("timestamp"), "1 minute"),
              col("page")
          ) \
          .count()
      
      # Write to output sink
      query = page_counts \
          .writeStream \
          .outputMode("complete") \
          .format("memory") \
          .queryName("page_counts") \
          .start()
      
      query.awaitTermination()
      </pre>
      
      <h3>3. Event Sourcing and CQRS Patterns</h3>
      <p>Event Sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) are powerful patterns for building streaming architectures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Store state changes as an immutable sequence of events</li>
        <li>Rebuild state by replaying events</li>
        <li>Separate read and write models for optimized performance</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Handling Common Challenges</h2>
      
      <h3>Exactly-Once Processing</h3>
      <p>Ensuring that each event is processed exactly once is critical for many applications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use idempotent consumers</li>
        <li>Implement deduplication mechanisms</li>
        <li>Leverage transaction support in modern streaming platforms</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>The Rise of Large Action Models: Redefining AI from Text to Action</h1>
      <p>Artificial intelligence is evolving beyond its traditional boundaries. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have revolutionized how machines understand and generate language, their ability to affect the real world is limited. Enter Large Action Models (LAMs), a new frontier in AI that fundamentally shifts the paradigm by enabling AI to bridge the gap between linguistic understanding and real-world actions.</p>

      <h2>LLMs vs. LAMs: Expanding Capabilities</h2>
      <p>LLMs are exceptional at understanding and generating human-like text. They excel in tasks involving language comprehension, such as summarizing articles, translating languages, or answering complex questions. However, they are passive—constrained to producing informational outputs and unable to perform tangible actions in a physical or digital environment.</p>
      <p>In contrast, LAMs are action-oriented AI systems, designed to actively execute tasks in response to user instructions. By integrating capabilities such as planning, tool usage, and complex decision-making, LAMs are equipped to interact with external systems and autonomously complete tasks. For example, while an LLM might understand a request to book a flight and provide recommendations, a LAM could go a step further by logging into a booking platform, selecting preferences, and completing the reservation autonomously.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Differentiators of LAMs:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> LAMs perform tasks without ongoing human input.</li>
        <li><strong>Environment Interaction:</strong> They interface with APIs, IoT devices, and GUIs to take action.</li>
        <li><strong>Goal-Oriented Planning:</strong> LAMs use advanced planning engines to achieve predefined objectives.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> LAMs learn from the outcomes of their actions, continuously improving over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />

      <h2>Core Capabilities of LAMs</h2>
      <p>LAMs represent a convergence of several advanced AI techniques, enabling them to operate as complete agents capable of planning, decision-making, and action execution. Here are their foundational capabilities:</p>

      <h3>1. Planning and Decision-Making</h3>
      <p>LAMs use neuro-symbolic AI and hierarchical planning to create and execute action sequences. These models analyze the current state of a given environment, predict outcomes, and determine the most efficient path to achieve goals. For example, a manufacturing LAM could optimize production schedules by analyzing order volumes and resource availability.</p>

      <h3>2. Tool Usage and Integration</h3>
      <p>By interfacing with external tools and systems, LAMs can manipulate software, control robotic processes, and manage complex workflows. They excel at multitasking in dynamic environments, such as automating inventory management or fine-tuning IoT device configurations in real time.</p>

      <h3>3. Execution and Adaptation</h3>
      <p>Unlike LLMs, which stop at suggesting solutions, LAMs act on their decisions. They execute tasks autonomously and iteratively refine their strategies based on feedback loops. This makes them ideal for applications requiring adaptability, such as routing supply chains during logistical disruptions.</p>
      <hr />

      <h2>Applications of LAMs in 2025</h2>
      <p>The versatility of LAMs allows them to impact various industries, from automating repetitive tasks to driving innovation in complex systems. Here are some key areas where LAMs are making strides:</p>

      <h3>Healthcare</h3>
      <p>LAMs can automate administrative tasks like scheduling, managing patient records, and monitoring real-time health data. Additionally, they assist clinicians by developing treatment plans and coordinating care logistics, freeing up time for patient interaction.</p>

      <p>As AI applications become increasingly prevalent, traditional databases are struggling to efficiently handle AI-specific data types, particularly vector embeddings. This guide explores vector databases and how data engineers can implement them effectively.</p>
      
      <h2>What Are Vector Databases?</h2>
      <p>Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store, index, and query high-dimensional vector embeddings efficiently. These embeddings are numerical representations of data (text, images, audio) that capture semantic meaning in a way that machines can understand and process.</p>
      
      <p>Unlike traditional databases that excel at exact matches and range queries, vector databases optimize for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Similarity searches (finding vectors that are "close to" a query vector)</li>
        <li>High-dimensional space operations</li>
        <li>Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms</li>
        <li>Efficient scaling of vector operations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Key Components of Vector Databases</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Vector Embeddings</h3>
      <p>Vector embeddings are the core data structures stored in vector databases. These are typically dense arrays of floating-point numbers generated by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Language models (for text data)</li>
        <li>Image encoders (for visual data)</li>
        <li>Audio encoders (for sound data)</li>
        <li>Multi-modal models (for mixed data types)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Example of generating text embeddings using OpenAI's embedding API:</p>
      
      <pre class="code-block">
      import openai
      
      # Set your API key
      openai.api_key = "your-api-key"
      
      def get_embedding(text):
          response = openai.Embedding.create(
              input=text,
              model="text-embedding-ada-002"
          )

      </pre>
      
      <h3>2. Indexing Strategies</h3>
      <p>Efficient indexing is critical for vector databases. Common indexing algorithms include:</p>
      
      <h4>Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Indexes:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)</strong>: Creates a multi-layered graph structure that allows for fast navigation between similar vectors</li>
        <li><strong>Inverted File Index (IVF)</strong>: Partitions the vector space into clusters to reduce search space</li>
        <li><strong>Product Quantization (PQ)</strong>: Compresses vectors by splitting them into subvectors, enabling memory-efficient storage</li>
        <li><strong>Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)</strong>: Uses hash functions that map similar vectors to the same buckets</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Each indexing approach offers different trade-offs between:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Query speed</li>
        <li>Recall accuracy</li>
        <li>Memory consumption</li>
        <li>Build time</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. Distance Metrics</h3>
      <p>Vector databases support various distance/similarity metrics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Euclidean Distance (L2)</strong>: Measures the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space</li>
        <li><strong>Cosine Similarity</strong>: Measures the cosine of the angle between vectors, focusing on their direction rather than magnitude</li>
        <li><strong>Dot Product</strong>: Measures the product of corresponding values in the vectors</li>
        <li><strong>Manhattan Distance (L1)</strong>: Measures the sum of absolute differences between vector components</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The choice of distance metric depends on the specific application and how the embeddings were generated.</p>

      <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) represent the next evolution in AI, capable of processing and generating content across different data types - text, images, audio, and potentially video. This technological leap is transforming how we approach data integration, enabling more sophisticated ways to connect and derive insights from heterogeneous data sources.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Multimodal LLMs</h2>
      <p>Unlike traditional LLMs that process only text, multimodal models can understand relationships across different data types:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Text-Image Understanding</strong>: Models like GPT-4 with Vision, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney can understand images and their relationship to text</li>
        <li><strong>Audio Processing</strong>: Models can transcribe, understand, and generate speech and other audio</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-modal Reasoning</strong>: The ability to draw connections between concepts across different modalities</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These capabilities emerge from architectures that combine specialized encoders for different data types with a unified representation space where relationships can be established.</p>

      <h2>Transforming Data Integration</h2>
      <p>Traditional data integration faces several challenges:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Schema mapping and normalization across diverse sources</li>
        <li>Handling unstructured or semi-structured data</li>
        <li>Extracting insights from non-text data formats</li>
        <li>Resolving semantic inconsistencies</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Multimodal LLMs address these challenges by providing novel approaches:</p>

      <h3>1. Unified Data Representation</h3>
      <p>Multimodal LLMs convert different data types into a shared embedding space, creating a "universal translator" for your data. This allows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Direct comparison of concepts across modalities</li>
        <li>Joint querying of heterogeneous data sources</li>
        <li>Revealing connections that might be missed in single-modality approaches</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Best Practices for Structuring dbt Projects on Snowflake</h2>
      <p>Setting up a scalable and maintainable dbt project tailored for Snowflake involves organizing models, sources, and workflows effectively:</p>
      <h3>Models and Sources:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Structure your models into <em>staging</em>, <em>intermediate</em>, and <em>final</em> layers. Staging models handle raw data preparation, intermediate models perform aggregations or transformations, and final models feed BI dashboards or analytics.</li>
        <li>Use dbt source definitions to document and monitor upstream data in Snowflake, ensuring clear visibility into dependencies.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tests:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Leverage dbt's built-in test suite for uniqueness, relationships, and accepted values to catch data issues early. For Snowflake transformations, focus on validating business-critical metrics.</li>
        <li>Consider disabling non-critical WARN tests to save resources while regularly analyzing the impact of critical ones.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Macros and Materializations:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use macros to encapsulate repetitive SQL logic, enabling greater reusability. Leverage Snowflake-specific configurations, like clustering keys or partitioning settings, for performance gains.</li>
        <li>Align dbt materializations (e.g., <em>incremental</em>, <em>ephemeral</em>) to Snowflake workloads. Incremental models are particularly effective for processing large datasets efficiently.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h2>Performance Tuning for dbt and Snowflake</h2>
      <p>To maximize the efficiency of dbt transformations running on Snowflake, consider the following optimization techniques:</p>
      <h3>Optimize Query Performance:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyze Snowflake's query profiles to identify bottlenecks such as expensive joins or excessive TableScans. Use clustered columns to speed up queries by reducing the number of micro-partitions scanned.</li>
        <li>Avoid complex views and use dbt models to encapsulate logic. Simplify queries with early filtering and limit the use of self-joins or repetitive CTEs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Materializations and Clustering:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Leverage Snowflake Materialized Views through dbt for frequently queried datasets, reducing query runtime.</li>
        <li>Use Snowflake's native data clustering features with dbt's <code>sort_type</code> configuration to automatically cluster data for faster reads.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Warehouse Scaling:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Configure Snowflake warehouses dynamically, scaling compute resources during peak dbt run times and reducing size for less intensive jobs. Monitor warehouse utilization to ensure optimal cost-performance balance.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cache and Zero-Copy Cloning:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Take advantage of Snowflake's query result cache and zero-copy cloning for efficient testing and debugging of dbt workflows without duplicating data.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h2>Future Outlook: The Role of dbt and Snowflake in 2025</h2>
      <p>As enterprises in 2025 increasingly adopt artificial intelligence and real-time analytics, the dbt-Snowflake combination is expected to adapt and thrive:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Integration with AI Workflows</strong>: dbt's transformation capabilities are becoming indispensable for feature engineering in machine learning pipelines. Combined with Snowflake's Feature Store, this integration will further enable AI-driven insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Serverless and Real-Time Pipelines</strong>: Snowflake's advancements in real-time data streaming (e.g., Snowpipe Streaming) and serverless execution will empower dbt to orchestrate low-latency workflows, catering to real-time analytics needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Collaboration and Governance</strong>: dbt's emerging features, like MetricFlow, will enable tighter alignment with Snowflake's governance and role-based access control, creating a unified analytics ecosystem.</li>
      </ol>
      <hr />
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The dbt-Snowflake duo exemplifies the modern data stack's potential by providing scalable, maintainable, and performant solutions for data transformations and analytics. By adopting best practices, tuning performance, and preparing for future trends, organizations can fully harness this pairing's capabilities. As data-driven strategies evolve, this partnership is set to remain a central pillar for enterprises in their data modernization journey.</p>

// --- Data Fetching Logic (Ideally move to lib/blog-api.ts) ---

// Using React.cache for deduplication within a single request/render
export const getAllPostSlugs = cache(async () => {
  console.log(`(Server) Fetching all slugs`); // Log for debugging
  // Simulate async operation if needed
  // await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
  return Object.keys(blogPosts);
});

export const getPostBySlug = cache(async (slug: string): Promise<BlogPost | null> => { // Add return type annotation
  console.log(`(Server) Fetching post: ${slug}`); // Log for debugging
  // Simulate async operation if needed
  // await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
  const postData = blogPosts[slug as keyof typeof blogPosts];
  if (!postData) {
    return null; // Return null if not found
  }
  // Combine the slug with the rest of the post data
  return { ...postData, slug };
});

// --- SSG Implementation ---

// Generate static paths at build time
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const slugs = await getAllPostSlugs();
  return slugs.map((slug) => ({
    slug: slug,
  }));
}

// Ensure only statically generated paths are allowed (optional, for full SSG)
export const dynamicParams = false;

// --- Metadata Generation ---

export async function generateMetadata({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPostBySlug(params.slug);

  if (!post) {
    return {
      title: 'Post Not Found',
    };
  }

  return {
    title: post.title,
    description: `Read the blog post titled: ${post.title}`, // Basic description
    // Add other metadata like open graph tags if needed
  };
}

// --- Page Component (React Server Component) ---

export default async function BlogPostPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const { slug } = params; // Get slug from params passed by Next.js

  // Fetch current post data server-side (uses cache)
  const post = await getPostBySlug(slug);

  // Handle post not found server-side
  if (!post) {
    notFound(); // Trigger 404 page
  }

  // Fetch all slugs to determine next/previous posts (uses cache)
  const slugs = await getAllPostSlugs();
  const currentIndex = slugs.findIndex(s => s === slug);

  const prevSlug = currentIndex > 0 ? slugs[currentIndex - 1] : null;
  const nextSlug = currentIndex < slugs.length - 1 ? slugs[currentIndex + 1] : null;

  // Fetch titles for prev/next posts (could be optimized by fetching all titles once)
  const prevPostMeta = prevSlug ? await getPostBySlug(prevSlug) : null;
  const nextPostMeta = nextSlug ? await getPostBySlug(nextSlug) : null;

  const prevPost = prevPostMeta ? { slug: prevPostMeta.slug, title: prevPostMeta.title } : null;
  const nextPost = nextPostMeta ? { slug: nextPostMeta.slug, title: nextPostMeta.title } : null;

  // No need for client-side check or redirection anymore
  // The component only renders if 'post' is found
  // Removed misplaced closing brace
